Game of Realms is a high-stakes contest with a total prize pool of **133,700 ATOM** that will see participants compete for tiered membership to co-own the Gno.land blockchain, the next-generation smart contract platform that uses the Gnolang (Gno) programming language. A series of complex technical and non-technical tasks will challenge contributors to create innovative patterns that push the chain to new limits. If you’re interested in helping build the most intuitive smart contract platform in web3—while gaining rewards for your contribution—join today by opening a [PR here](https://github.com/gnolang/gno).\n\nThe Game of Realms contest will allow participants to get a feel for the Gno.land platform while building smart contracts and applications in the ecosystem. It will take place in two stages, phase one and phase two. Phase one is about building the core infrastructure, tools, and tutorials necessary to open the gates to broader participation and will be held off-chain. Phase two, on the other hand, will take place after the successful completion of phase one and be held on-chain, where contributors will build smart contracts on the platform.\n\nIn addition to the ATOM prize pool, the best contributors will also be awarded (mostly) initial-level membership to govern the upcoming mainnet. Membership will be allocated according to the quality and extensiveness of the contribution—the higher the quality, the higher the tier, and the greater the voting rights and rewards. The top equal members will be composed of peers who have contributed the most to the ecosystem and have an understanding of its core components. Top members will also have aligned core moral values. This is essential so that members can maintain the chain together according to its Constitution (TBD** and ultimately create a sustainable ecosystem that rewards all valuable contributions.\n\n## Game of Realms - Phase One (Off-Chain)\n\nWhile we aim to encourage cross-collaboration between devs and non-techs, phase one of the contest is recommended for advanced developers who are more autonomous and can contribute with limited guidelines and support. Accounting for around one-third of the total **133,700 ATOM** prize pool, getting a headstart in phase one will allow seasoned devs to kick the tires on the Gno.land platform, contribute with limited competition, and build the tools needed to open the second phase.\n\nDuring phase one, participants will open PRs against repos from the Gnolang organization. Phase one contributors will be expected to document and share their work efficiently to enable others to use it without conflicts. Your contribution is vital to the success of the contest, the Gno.land platform, and the Cosmos ecosystem at large, especially now, with discussions to move the Cosmos Hub’s core operations on-chain by establishing a DAO system.\n\nThe first DAO to be created will be the [Decentralists DAO](https://github.com/decentralists/DAO), which will provide Cosmonauts with transparency, accountability, and decentralization. The Decentralists DAO will improve discourse, organization management, development, and conflict resolution through smart contracts, and will organize itself into a set of tightly-aligned sub-DAOs dedicated to specific topics, such as engineering and funding.\n\nSo, how does this relate to Game of Realms and what type of contributions are judges looking for? Here are some examples, in order of priority:\n\n* **Define and Implement an Evaluation DAO:** For the Game of Realms contest, a sub-DAO – the Evaluation DAO – is needed to evaluate contributions during phase two and attribute rewards accordingly. Using a DAO will allow community members to vote on the best contributions for the platform. Implementation of the Evaluation DAO is the only step that must be approved by the core team because of its key role in the competition and the future of the platform. Once the DAO is in place, all previous and further contributions will be reviewed collectively by DAO members.\n\n* **Create Tutorials to Onboard More Participants:** We need experienced devs to write or record tutorials to help more people get started during phase two of the competition (and beyond) and to help grow the Gno.land developer community. These tutorials can include topics like interacting with the chain from the CLI, step-by-step guides to creating smart contracts in Gno, tips for running a local dev environment, fast prototyping with gnodev, or they can be tutorials dedicated to certain audiences, such as developers coming from Solidity or web2. All tutorials should be added to the [awesome-gno GitHub repo](https://github.com/gnolang/awesome-gno).\n\n* **Define and Implement a Governance Contract Suite:** In this challenge, developers will be expected to define and implement a governance contract suite capable of competing with existing chains’ governance modules. If you think you can improve the governance system of Cosmos Hub, this is your chance to show us how!\n\nPhase one challenges will stay open during phase two. No competition points will be attributed during this phase as the points will be retro-funded by the DAO and awarded during phase two.\n\n## Game of Realms - Phase Two (On-Chain)\n\nPhase two of Game of Realms will onboard more people to the platform and begin as soon as sufficient materials are completed from phase one. Accounting for around two-thirds of the total 133,700 ATOM prize pool, phase two will be open to both developers and non-technicals who can follow tutorials, create smart contracts, or provide other important contributions to win rewards and scale the platform. As phase two will be held directly on-chain, contributors can submit their contributions to the DAO without publishing them on the main GitHub repo. However, we strongly encourage you to use GitHub as it’s an important resource that helps the community gain a better understanding through specific examples.\n\n_We are currently preparing the challenges for participants of phase two and are looking for your input. Let us know what type of smart contracts you would like to see (minimal or with multiple features) in our upcoming Game of Realms AMA on Tuesday, January 24 at 4 pm UTC. Note that this is a text based AMA so make sure to add your questions before or during the AMA in the #AMA-questions channel on the [Gno.land discord](https://discord.gg/S8nKUqwkPn).\n_Once we have collected your feedback and requests, we will finalize the challenge categories.

This is essential so that members can maintain the chain together according to its Constitution (TBD** and ultimately create a sustainable ecosystem that rewards all valuable contributions.\n\n## Game of Realms - Phase One (Off-Chain)\n\nWhile we aim to encourage cross-collaboration between devs and non-techs, phase one of the contest is recommended for advanced developers who are more autonomous and can contribute with limited guidelines and support. Accounting for around one-third of the total **133,700 ATOM** prize pool, getting a headstart in phase one will allow seasoned devs to kick the tires on the Gno.land platform, contribute with limited competition, and build the tools needed to open the second phase.\n\nDuring phase one, participants will open PRs against repos from the Gnolang organization. Phase one contributors will be expected to document and share their work efficiently to enable others to use it without conflicts. Your contribution is vital to the success of the contest, the Gno.land platform, and the Cosmos ecosystem at large, especially now, with discussions to move the Cosmos Hub’s core operations on-chain by establishing a DAO system.\n\nThe first DAO to be created will be the [Decentralists DAO](https://github.com/decentralists/DAO), which will provide Cosmonauts with transparency, accountability, and decentralization. The Decentralists DAO will improve discourse, organization management, development, and conflict resolution through smart contracts, and will organize itself into a set of tightly-aligned sub-DAOs dedicated to specific topics, such as engineering and funding.\n\nSo, how does this relate to Game of Realms and what type of contributions are judges looking for? Here are some examples, in order of priority:\n\n* **Define and Implement an Evaluation DAO:** For the Game of Realms contest, a sub-DAO – the Evaluation DAO – is needed to evaluate contributions during phase two and attribute rewards accordingly. Using a DAO will allow community members to vote on the best contributions for the platform. Implementation of the Evaluation DAO is the only step that must be approved by the core team because of its key role in the competition and the future of the platform. Once the DAO is in place, all previous and further contributions will be reviewed collectively by DAO members.\n\n* **Create Tutorials to Onboard More Participants:** We need experienced devs to write or record tutorials to help more people get started during phase two of the competition (and beyond) and to help grow the Gno.land developer community. These tutorials can include topics like interacting with the chain from the CLI, step-by-step guides to creating smart contracts in Gno, tips for running a local dev environment, fast prototyping with gnodev, or they can be tutorials dedicated to certain audiences, such as developers coming from Solidity or web2. All tutorials should be added to the [awesome-gno GitHub repo](https://github.com/gnolang/awesome-gno).\n\n* **Define and Implement a Governance Contract Suite:** In this challenge, developers will be expected to define and implement a governance contract suite capable of competing with existing chains’ governance modules. If you think you can improve the governance system of Cosmos Hub, this is your chance to show us how!\n\nPhase one challenges will stay open during phase two. No competition points will be attributed during this phase as the points will be retro-funded by the DAO and awarded during phase two.\n\n## Game of Realms - Phase Two (On-Chain)\n\nPhase two of Game of Realms will onboard more people to the platform and begin as soon as sufficient materials are completed from phase one. Accounting for around two-thirds of the total 133,700 ATOM prize pool, phase two will be open to both developers and non-technicals who can follow tutorials, create smart contracts, or provide other important contributions to win rewards and scale the platform. As phase two will be held directly on-chain, contributors can submit their contributions to the DAO without publishing them on the main GitHub repo. However, we strongly encourage you to use GitHub as it’s an important resource that helps the community gain a better understanding through specific examples.\n\n_We are currently preparing the challenges for participants of phase two and are looking for your input. Let us know what type of smart contracts you would like to see (minimal or with multiple features) in our upcoming Game of Realms AMA on Tuesday, January 24 at 4 pm UTC. Note that this is a text based AMA so make sure to add your questions before or during the AMA in the #AMA-questions channel on the [Gno.land discord](https://discord.gg/S8nKUqwkPn).\n_Once we have collected your feedback and requests, we will finalize the challenge categories.

Game of Realms is a high-stakes contest with a total prize pool of **133,700 ATOM** that will see participants compete for tiered membership to co-own the Gno.land blockchain, the next-generation smart contract platform that uses the Gnolang (Gno) programming language. A series of complex technical and non-technical tasks will challenge contributors to create innovative patterns that push the chain to new limits. If you’re interested in helping build the most intuitive smart contract platform in web3—while gaining rewards for your contribution—join today by opening a [PR here](https://github.com/gnolang/gno).\n\nThe Game of Realms contest will allow participants to get a feel for the Gno.land platform while building smart contracts and applications in the ecosystem. It will take place in two stages, phase one and phase two. Phase one is about building the core infrastructure, tools, and tutorials necessary to open the gates to broader participation and will be held off-chain. Phase two, on the other hand, will take place after the successful completion of phase one and be held on-chain, where contributors will build smart contracts on the platform.\n\nIn addition to the ATOM prize pool, the best contributors will also be awarded (mostly) initial-level membership to govern the upcoming mainnet. Membership will be allocated according to the quality and extensiveness of the contribution—the higher the quality, the higher the tier, and the greater the voting rights and rewards. The top equal members will be composed of peers who have contributed the most to the ecosystem and have an understanding of its core components. Top members will also have aligned core moral values. This is essential so that members can maintain the chain together according to its Constitution (TBD** and ultimately create a sustainable ecosystem that rewards all valuable contributions.\n\n## Game of Realms - Phase One (Off-Chain)\n\nWhile we aim to encourage cross-collaboration between devs and non-techs, phase one of the contest is recommended for advanced developers who are more autonomous and can contribute with limited guidelines and support. Accounting for around one-third of the total **133,700 ATOM** prize pool, getting a headstart in phase one will allow seasoned devs to kick the tires on the Gno.land platform, contribute with limited competition, and build the tools needed to open the second phase.\n\nDuring phase one, participants will open PRs against repos from the Gnolang organization. Phase one contributors will be expected to document and share their work efficiently to enable others to use it without conflicts. Your contribution is vital to the success of the contest, the Gno.land platform, and the Cosmos ecosystem at large, especially now, with discussions to move the Cosmos Hub’s core operations on-chain by establishing a DAO system.\n\nThe first DAO to be created will be the [Decentralists DAO](https://github.com/decentralists/DAO), which will provide Cosmonauts with transparency, accountability, and decentralization. The Decentralists DAO will improve discourse, organization management, development, and conflict resolution through smart contracts, and will organize itself into a set of tightly-aligned sub-DAOs dedicated to specific topics, such as engineering and funding.\n\nSo, how does this relate to Game of Realms and what type of contributions are judges looking for? Here are some examples, in order of priority:\n\n* **Define and Implement an Evaluation DAO:** For the Game of Realms contest, a sub-DAO – the Evaluation DAO – is needed to evaluate contributions during phase two and attribute rewards accordingly. Using a DAO will allow community members to vote on the best contributions for the platform. Implementation of the Evaluation DAO is the only step that must be approved by the core team because of its key role in the competition and the future of the platform. Once the DAO is in place, all previous and further contributions will be reviewed collectively by DAO members.\n\n* **Create Tutorials to Onboard More Participants:** We need experienced devs to write or record tutorials to help more people get started during phase two of the competition (and beyond) and to help grow the Gno.land developer community. These tutorials can include topics like interacting with the chain from the CLI, step-by-step guides to creating smart contracts in Gno, tips for running a local dev environment, fast prototyping with gnodev, or they can be tutorials dedicated to certain audiences, such as developers coming from Solidity or web2. All tutorials should be added to the [awesome-gno GitHub repo](https://github.com/gnolang/awesome-gno).\n\n* **Define and Implement a Governance Contract Suite:** In this challenge, developers will be expected to define and implement a governance contract suite capable of competing with existing chains’ governance modules. If you think you can improve the governance system of Cosmos Hub, this is your chance to show us how!\n\nPhase one challenges will stay open during phase two. No competition points will be attributed during this phase as the points will be retro-funded by the DAO and awarded during phase two.\n\n## Game of Realms - Phase Two (On-Chain)\n\nPhase two of Game of Realms will onboard more people to the platform and begin as soon as sufficient materials are completed from phase one. Accounting for around two-thirds of the total 133,700 ATOM prize pool, phase two will be open to both developers and non-technicals who can follow tutorials, create smart contracts, or provide other important contributions to win rewards and scale the platform. As phase two will be held directly on-chain, contributors can submit their contributions to the DAO without publishing them on the main GitHub repo. However, we strongly encourage you to use GitHub as it’s an important resource that helps the community gain a better understanding through specific examples.\n\n_We are currently preparing the challenges for participants of phase two and are looking for your input.
